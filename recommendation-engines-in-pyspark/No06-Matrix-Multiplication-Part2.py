Let's put your matrix multiplication skills to test.

Instructions
100 XP
Use the .shape method to understand the dimensions of matrices C and D, and determine whether these two matrices can be multiplied together or not.
If they can be multiplied, use the np.matmul() method to multiply them. If not, set C_times_D to None.
'''

# Code
# Print the dimensions of C
print(C.shape)

# Print the dimensions of D
print(D.shape)

# Can C and D be multiplied together?
C_times_D = None
